# Hosting Alternative: Glitch

## The Problem with Neocities

Neocities has Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions that block:
- ❌ Google Tag Manager
- ❌ Reddit Pixel
- ❌ Most third-party tracking scripts
- ❌ External JavaScript

This means GTM and marketing pixels **will not work** on Neocities.
